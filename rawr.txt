Oh, Elden Ring\nI'll Soon Birth Thee Anew
I Command Thee, Kneel!
Join The Serpent King, As Family
Who Is To Say That The Cardinal Sin Must Be Cardinal Forever
"...You Are Maidenless
Someone Must Extinguish Thy Flame
Now Cometh The Age Of Stars
You Will Witness True Horror
Forefathers One And All! Bear Witness!
I Could Never Betray Her, No Matter What Happens. Ranni...She Needs Me
I Was Able To Live As My Own Person, If Only In Passing
I Have Given Thee Courtesy Enough. Now I Fight As Hoarah Loux, Warrior
Well Then, Shall We? My Dear Consort Eternal
Have It Writ Upon Thy Meagre Grave: Felled By Morgott, Last Of All Kings
The Fallen Leaves Tell A Story. Of How A Tarnished Became Elden Lord
